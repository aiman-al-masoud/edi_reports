Warmup time is used by the benchmarking tool's client to start a connection with the 
webserver, before actually beginning to transfer benchmark data, you can verify that some traffic
is exchanged during the warmup phase using a sniffer such as Wireshark.

When warmup time > 0, "time for connect" and "time to 1st byte" tend to become 0.
